#Lore

This web-app utilizes Markov Chains, a single-state "machine", in order to create psuedo-realistic filler texts. Useful for various types of developers, this application improves upon the typical "lorem ipsum" texts and instead provides filler, or dummy, text that is both tailored to a specific length, and from a specific type of source (e.g. old literature, modern literature, or social media) - which will be partially contributed to by users. Additionally, using its API, users will be able to quickly request for texts with their desired parameters in their own code, as an alternative to the web-based interface.

* Tweepy API
* PRAW (Reddit API)
